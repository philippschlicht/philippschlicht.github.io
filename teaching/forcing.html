<p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  Day and time:
  Tuesdays 2-4pm. Begins 18 January, 2022.
  <li>
  Location: online. The zoom link will be posted here.
  <li>
  The first meeting on 18 January will be a planning meeting.
  I would like to discuss what is the background of the audience and whether the lecture's time works for everyone.
  <li>
  Email me (philipp.schlicht@bristol.ac.uk) if you are thinking of participating or just come to the first meeting.

The course is intended for mathematicians who want to know how independence proofs work.
I plan to give a brief introduction to logic and set theory in the first few lectures, depending on the audience.
Forcing is a method introduced by Paul Cohen in 1963 to prove the independence of the continuum hypothesis.
Together with earlier work of G&ouml;del, his result showed that the continuum hypothesis can be neither proved nor disproved.
This is what we will aim for in the course.
Nowadays, forcing is a powerful method for proving independence with applications in topology, measure theory, analysis and algebra.
Forcing has also led to new axioms such as Martin's axiom that try to fill the gap left by independence results.

<br>
<p>
The course  is informal and friendly and audience members are encouraged to participate and ask questions.
I will share lecture notes with participants and provide simple exercises in the course of the lecture.
The meetings will be a combination of going through lecture notes and discussing questions and some exercises.

<br>

Here is the plan for the course.
I add a few references to the literature for further reading.

<li>
  Construction of Boolean-valued models of set theory
<li>
  The poset approach to forcing

<p><blockquote>
''There are certainly moments in any mathematical discovery when the resolution of a problem takes place at such a subconscious level that, in retrospect, it seems impossible to dissect it and explain its origin. Rather, the entire idea presents itself at once, often perhaps in a vague form, but gradually becomes more precise. Since the entire new 'model' M(a) is constructed by transfinite induction on ordinals, the definition of what is meant by saying a is generic must also be given by a transfinite induction. Yet a, as a set of integers, occurs very early in the rank hierarchy of sets, so there can be no question of building a by means of a transfinite induction. The answer is this: the set a will not be determined completely, yet properties of a will be completely determined on the basis of very incomplete information about a. I would like to pause and ask the reader to contemplate the seeming contradiction in the above. This idea as it presented itself to me, appeared so different from any normal way of thinking, that I felt it could have enormous consequences. On the other hand, it seemed to skirt the possibility of contradiction in a very perilous manner. Of course, a new generation has arisen who imbibe this idea with their first serious exposure to set theory, and for them, presumably, it does not have the mystical quality that it had for me when I first thought of it. How could one decide whether a statement about a is true, before we have a? In a somewhat exaggerated sense, it seemed that I would have to examine the very meaning of truth and think about it in a new way.''
