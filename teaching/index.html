		<b>Time:</b> Thursdays 15:00-17:00.
		<b>Dates:</b> 17th October, 24th October, 29th October (Tuesday 13:00-15:00), 31st October, 14th November, 15th November (Friday 13:00-15:00), 28th November, 5th December </br>

  <p> <b> Abstract:</b>
	We study equivalence relations induced by actions of countable groups and their comparison with respect to Borel reducibility and orbit equivalence.
	This theme connects descriptive set theory, dynamics and logic.
  Topics include Dye's theorem that ergodic probability preserving actions of the integers are all orbit equivalent, and the E_0-dichotomy characterizing non-smooth equivalence relations
	The course requires only basic knowledge of topology, measure theory and group actions.
