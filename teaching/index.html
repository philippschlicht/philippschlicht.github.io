  <p>Lecture course on <b>Borel equivalence relations and group actions</b>, University of Bristol, October-December 2019
		</p>
  <p> <b> Schedule:</b> See the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/tcc/tcc-current-courses">TCC schedule</a>.
		<b>Time:</b> Thursdays 15:00-17:00.
		<b>Dates:</b> 17th October, 24th October, 29th October (Tuesday 13:00-15:00), 31st October, 14th November, 15th November (Friday 13:00-15:00), 28th November, 5th December </br>

  <p> <b> Abstract:</b>
	We study equivalence relations induced by actions of countable groups and their comparison with respect to Borel reducibility and orbit equivalence.
  Topics include
	(a) Dye's theorem: ergodic probability preserving actions of the integers are all orbit equivalent and
	(b) the E_0-dichotomy, characterizing non-smooth equivalence relations. 
	The topic connects descriptive set theory, dynamics and logic.
	The course requires only basic knowledge of group actions and measure theory.
