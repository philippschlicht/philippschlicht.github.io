  <p> <b> Abstract:</b>
	We study equivalence relations induced by actions of countable groups and their comparison with respect to Borel reducibility.
	This is a subfield of descriptive set theory and dynamics with applications in logic, e.g. to the complexity of isomorphism for classes of countable structures.<br>
	We plan to cover
	(a) Dye's theorem: actions of the integers that are sufficiently nice (preserve an ergodic probability measure) are all orbit equivalent and
	(b) the E_0-dichotomy: a useful characterization when an equivalence relation is non-trivial, from the viewpoint of reducibility.
	The course requires only basic knowledge of group actions and measure theory.
