  <p> <b> Abstract:</b>
	We want to study equivalence relations induced by actions of countable groups and orbit equivalence both from the descriptive and measure theoretic viewpoint.
	The theme is sketched in the introduction of the lecture notes below and some literature is mentioned there. It has been in the focus of research in descriptive set theory, dynamics and mesaured group theory for the last decades, but there are still many outstanding open problems.
  In these lectures, I would like to give an introduction to this active field and cover several fundamental results such as Dye's theorem that ergodic probability preserving actions of the integers are all orbit equivalent and the E_0-dichotomy characterizing non-smooth equivalence relations.
	I will only presuppose some basic knowledge of topology, measure theory and group actions.
