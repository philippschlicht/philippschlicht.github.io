  <p> October-December 2019: Lecture course on Borel equivalence relations and group actions, University of Bristol (TCC)
		</p>

  <p> Abstract:
	We study equivalence relations induced by group actions and how they compare with respect to Borel reducibility.
	This is a subfield of descriptive set theory and dynamics.
	One of its applications in logic is the study of the complexity of isomorphism for various classes of countable structures.<br> <br>
	The plan is to cover
	(a) Dye's theorem: actions of the integers that are sufficiently nice (preserve an ergodic probability measure) are all orbit equivalent and
	(b) the E_0-dichotomy: a useful characterization when an equivalence relation is non-trivial, from the viewpoint of reducibility.
	  </p>

	<p> Prerequisites:
	Basic knowledge of groups and group actions; basic measure theory; notions from descriptive set theory such as Borel and analytic sets and their properties will be covered as needed.
