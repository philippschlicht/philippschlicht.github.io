  <p> October-December 2019: Lecture course on Borel equivalence relations and group actions, University of Bristol (TCC)
		</p>

  <p> Abstract:
	We study equivalence relations induced by group actions and how they compare with respect to Borel reducibility.
	This is a subfield of descriptive set theory and dynamics.
	One of its applications in logic is the study of the complexity of isomorphism for various classes of countable structures.
	The plan is to cover
	(a) Dye's theorem: actions of the integers that are sufficiently nice (preserve an ergodic probability measure) are all orbit equivalent and
	(b) the E_0-dichotomy: a useful characterization when an equivalence relation is non-trivial, from the viewpoint of reducibility.
	  </p>

	<p> Prerequisites:
	Basic knowledge of groups and group actions; basic measure theory; notions from descriptive set theory such as Borel and analytic sets and their properties will be covered as needed.
