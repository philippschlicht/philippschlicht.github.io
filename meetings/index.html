	<h1>Set theory in the United Kingdom, Bristol, 8 May 2019</h1>
	
	<i>Set Theory in the United Kingdom</i> is a new joint research group in set theory funded by the <a href="https://www.lms.ac.uk">London Mathematical Society</a> (Scheme 3) with members at the Universities of Bristol, Cambridge, East Anglia, Leeds, Oxford, Warwick and University College London.<br> <br> 
	
A preliminary meeting (STUK 0) of the joint research group was held at the Royal Society in London on 7 November 2018. The first meeting (<a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~dbl25/STUK/1/">STUK 1</a>) took place Cambridge on 16 February 2019. <br> <br> 


	STUK 2 will take place on Wednesday, 8 May 2019 at the School of Mathematics of the University of Bristol, Howard house, Queen's avenue, Bristol BS8 1SD. 
	The local organizers are <a href="https://dsnielsen.com">Dan Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://philippschlicht.github.io">Philipp Schlicht</a> and <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~mapdw/">Philip Welch</a>.

	<h2>Abstracts</h2>

Andrew Brooke-Taylor: Set theory and category theory <br> <br> 

Victoria Gitman: Set theory in second-order <br> <br> 

Classes, from class forcing notions to elementary embeddings of the universe to inner models, play a fundamental role in modern set theory. But within first-order set theory we are limited to studying only definable classes and we cannot even express properties that necessitate quantifying over classes. Second-order set theory is a formal framework in which a model consists both of a collection of sets and a collection of classes (which are themselves collections of sets). In second-order set theory, we can study classes such as truth predicates, which can never be definable over a model of ZFC, and properties that, for instance, quantify over all inner models. With this formal background we can develop a theory of class forcing that explains why and when class forcing behaves differently from set forcing. In this talk, I will discuss a hierarchy of second-order set theories, starting from the weak G&ouml;del-Bernays set theory GBC and going beyond the relatively strong Kelley-Morse theory KM. I will give an overview of a number of interesting second-order set theoretic principles that arose out of recent work in this area, such as, class choice principles, transfinite recursion with classes, determinacy of games on the ordinals, and the class Fodor Principle. The study of where these principles fit in the hierarchy of second-order set theories should serve as the beginning of a reverse mathematics program that I hope this talk will encourage set theorists to take part in. <br> <br>
