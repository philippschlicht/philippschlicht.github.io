        <p><b>Braids: our past informing our future</b></p>
        <p>Braids have been objects of interest for humans for many millennia, appearing in our hair, our art, and our clothing, for example.  In 1925, Emil Artin introduced the notion of a `braid group', launching the study of braids as algebraic objects.  In this talk we will describe some important types of braid groups that appear widely in geometry and topology, survey recent developments in our understanding of their fundamental structures, and highlight some contemporary problems that inform these investigations.</p>

        <p>A harmonic function on a group <em>G</em> is a function which is equal to the average of its translates, average for a measure <em>m</em> whose support is finite and spans <em>G</em>.
        We want to describe the extremal positive harmonic functions <em>h</em> on <em>G</em>.

        </p><p>By a theorem of Choquet and Deny, when <em>G</em> is abelian, <em>h</em> is a character.
        By a theorem of Margulis, when <em>G</em> is nilpotent and <em>m</em> is symmetric, <em>h</em> is also a character.
        By a theorem of Ancona, when <em>G</em> is hyperbolic and <em>m</em> is symmetric, these functions <em>h</em> are parametrized by the boundary of <em>G</em>.

        </p><p>We will see that, when the group <em>G</em> is the Heisenberg group, the classical partition function occurs as a function <em>h</em> and that this function is the only one beyond characters.

        <p><b>An invitation to dilation surfaces</b>
        </p><p>A dilation surface is a geometric object obtained from gluing together Euclidean polygons along parallel sides, allowing some form of stretching when performing such gluings. These are interesting geometric objects in their own right : they carry natural complex structures which makes for a connection with Teichmüller theory. From that point one can define moduli spaces of such objects and start asking geometry-oriented questions.
        </p><p>Dilation surfaces also carry natural families of foliations; they are therefore objects of interest from a dynamical viewpoint as well.
        </p><p>In this talk I will try to give a gentle introduction to these objects and motivate a series of questions of importance in the topic. If time permits, I will allow myself to advertise my own work on the subject.

	<p><b>Critical exponents of subgroups of groups acting on Gromov hyperbolic spaces, and amenability</b></p>

	<p>This is joint work with R. Coulon, B. Schapira and S. Tapie.</p>
<p>One of the first things we learn about a (proper) Gromov hyperbolic geodesic space <i>X</i> is the construction of the visual boundary &part;<i>X</i>. An ergodic theorist then learns that for a non-elementary discrete group of isometries <i>G</i> acting properly on <i>X</i>, there is an interesting family of <i>s</i>-quasi-conformal measures on &part;<i>X</i>, called Patterson-Sullivan measures. And the smallest such <i>s</i> coincides with the critical exponent <i>&delta;<sub>G</sub></i> of <i>G</i>: that is, <i>&delta;<sub>G</sub></i> is the exponential growth in <i>R</i> of <i>Gx &cap; B(x,R) &sub; X</i>. A general question might be, given a subgroup <i>H</i> of <i>G</i>, how do we compare <i>&delta;<sub>H</sub></i> and <i>&delta;<sub>G</sub></i>? For <i>G</i> with "good dynamics", we expect that <i>&delta;<sub>G</sub> = &delta;<sub>H</sub></i> if and only if <i>H</i> is co-amenable in <i>G</i>.
	Indeed, we may see Grigorchuk's co-growth criterion as an instance of this question where <i>X</i> is a Cayley graph of a free group. Differently, in the case that <i>X</i> is a rank 1 symmetric space, some results were known using Brooks' characterisation of amenability in terms of the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian. I will motivate the question, and say something about our new approach, for which we have an optimal conclusion,  that if the action of <i>G</i> is SPR, then we have δ<sub>G</sub> = δ<sub>H</sub> if and only if <i>H</i> is co-amenable in <i>G</i>. </p>

	<p><b>Quasi-isometric diversity of marked groups</b></p>

<p> Quasi-isometries are maps between metric spaces that perturb distances only by multiplicative and additive constants. Such maps are especially important in Geometric Group Theory as they give rise to a natural equivalence relation between finitely generated groups, equipped with their word metrics. The main goal of Asymptotic Group Theory, initiated by Gromov, is to study finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometries and look for group-theoretic properties that are invariant under this equivalence relation.</p>

<p>In the talk I will discuss a method, based on Descriptive Set Theory, which allows to show that various classes of finitely generated groups contain continuously many quasi-isometry classes. We will apply this technique to show that there is a continuum of 2-generated pairwise non-quasi-isometric groups which satisfy various exotic properties (such are being simple, torsion and divisible, or being a Tarski monster, or having asymptotic dimension 1). The talk will be based on a joint work with Denis Osin and Stefan Witzel. </p>

        </p><p>Given a compact, orientable surface, we can define many associated graphs which have multicurves as vertices. A first example is the curve graph, which has a vertex for every isotopy class of curves and an edge between two vertices if the curves are disjoint. I will present joint work with Jacob Russell on certain such graphs, giving a classification of when they are hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic.

        <p><b>Hyperbolic groups with locally contractible boundaries</b>
        </p><p>It is an fundamental principle of geometric group theory that large scale geometric properties of metric spaces on which a group acts should be considered properties of the group itself. If a given group acts on a hyperbolic metric space then a particularly natural example of such a large scale property is the Gromov boundary of that space: this is a topological space that compactifies the hyperbolic space at infinity. These spaces can be quite complicated, and I will begin giving some examples to illustrate this. I will then describe a new result that restricts the topological pathologies of a Gromov boundary by characterising the circumstances under which the boundary is locally contractible. This work generalises a theorem of Bestvina and Mess.</p>

        <p><b>Three dichotomies for connected unimodular Lie groups</b>
        </p><p>Using the Levi decomposition theorem, Lie groups are usually studied in two separate classes: semisimple and solvable. Both these classes further divide into two subclasses with very different behaviour: semisimple groups split into the rank 1 and higher rank cases; while solvable groups divide into those of polynomial growth and those of exponential growth.

</p><p>Amongst connected unimodular Lie groups, let us say that G is "small" if it shares a cocompact subgroup with some direct product of a rank one simple Lie group and a solvable Lie group with polynomial growth. Otherwise, we say G is "large". We present three strong dichotomies which distinguish "small" and "large" Lie groups; which are respectively algebraic, coarse geometric, and local analytic in nature. As an application we will show that Baumslag-Solitar groups admit a similar "small"/"large" dichotomy. This is part of a joint project with John Mackay and Romain Tessera.</p>

  <i>Description</i>
  Generalized descriptive set theory studies spaces of functions on uncountable regular cardinals and properties of their definable subsets (for an introduction, see <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09292>[AMR]</a> or <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4311>[FHK]</a>).
  This is a relatively new and very active field of set theoretic research.
  <!-- that has attracted much interest.-->
  The talks will focus on generalized descriptive set theory and its connections with model theory (e.g. classification theory) and infinite combinatorics (e.g. cardinal characteristics),
  with two tutorials on model theory and connections.
  Our aim is to bring together several research groups, outline directions of future research and
  collect open research questions.
  This continues workshops in <a href=https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/spag/ml/AST2014/>Amsterdam</a> in November 2014, <a href=http://home.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de/giorgio/hamburg.html>Hamburg</a> in September 2015, <a href=https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/events/eventpages/2016/bonn-set-theory-workshop-2016-generalized-baire-spaces/>Bonn</a> in September 2016, <a href=http://events.illc.uva.nl/KNAW2018/>Amsterdam</a> in August 2018 and a symposium in Prague in August 2019.

  </p>

  <p>
  <i>Participate</i>
  The workshop is open to everyone, with a conference fee of 20 GBP for those participating in the whole meeting.
  If you intend to participate, please send an email to philipp.schlicht@bristol.ac.uk by the 17th of January.
  If you plan to give a contributed talk of 20 minutes, please let us know soon to secure a slot.
