I work at the <a href="https://www.diism.unisi.it/it">dipartimento di ingegneria dell'informazione e scienze matematiche</a> of the university of Siena as a tenure track researcher (rtt).

My research is in
<!--areas are field is mathematical logic, in particular set theory, large cardinals, -->
descriptive set theory, infinite combinatorics and applications to topology, analysis, model theory, graph theory, computability and theoretical computer science.

<!--I work on the EPSRC project ''Graphs on generalised Baire spaces'' with <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~mapdw/">Prof. Philip Welch</a> at the University of Bristol.-->
<!--The project aims to understand the structure of large graphs that satisfy topological conditions.-->
A typocal problem of descriptive combinatorics is under
which circumstances you can colour a graph with few colours such that no adjacent vertices are assigned the same colour. 
We study this problem in the context of graphs of a specified complexity such as open, closed or Borel as a subset of the plane.
The study of such graphs led Todorcevic to devise the open colouring axiom.
We aim to understand graphs and hypergraphs of finite and infinite dimension on large spaces that appear naturally in set theory and model theory.

<!--This belong to a field with exciting connections with infinite combinatorics and large cardinals and applications to descriptive set theory and classification problems.-->
