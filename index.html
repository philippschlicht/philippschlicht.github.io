I work as a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en">Marie Curie Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/">School of Mathematics</a> of the University of Bristol.
My current research project with <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~mapdw/">Philip Welch</a> is called 'Inner models and infinite computations'.

<br><br>

My research focus is in set theory -- in particular descriptive set theory, forcing, large cardinals -- and computability.
