<h2>About</h2>

<p>
I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.logic.univie.ac.at/Home.html">Logic Group</a> of the <a href="https://mathematik.univie.ac.at">Faculty of Mathematics</a> of the University of Vienna.
<br><br>

<!--
I am currently still affiliated to the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/">School of Mathematics</a> of the University of Bristol as a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en">Marie Curie Research Fellow</a> on leave. I am further affiliated to the <a href="https://www.math.uni-bonn.de">  Mathematical Institute</a> of the University of Bonn as a Privatdozent.

My research focus is in Set Theory -- in particular descriptive set theory, forcing, large cardinals -- and computability.
<!--My current research project with <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~mapdw/">Philip Welch</a> is called 'Inner models and infinite computations'.-->
