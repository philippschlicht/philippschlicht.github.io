I work as a Marie Curie Research Fellow at the School of Mathematics of the University of Bristol.
My current research project with Philip Welch is called 'Inner models and infinite computations'.

<br><br>

My research focus is in set theory -- in particular descriptive set theory, forcing, large cardinals -- and computability.
