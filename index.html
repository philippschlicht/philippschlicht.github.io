<h2>About</h2>

<p>
I work at the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/">School of Mathematics</a> of the University of Bristol as an EPSRC Fellow
on the project 'Graphs on generalised Baire spaces' with <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~mapdw/">Prof. Philip Welch</a>.
This project aims to understand the structure of large graphs that satisfy topological conditions.
For instance, can you colour a graph with few colours such that no adjacent vertices are assigned the same colour?
A typical problem is to describe graphs which admit such colorings. 
It is part of a recent area that has come into focus due to exciting connections with infinite combinatorics,
deep set theoretic problems and classification problems in model theory.
The topological restrictions place this project within the field of descriptive set theory,
which studies structural properties definable objects.
