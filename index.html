<h1>About me.</h1>
<p>
I work as a Marie Curie Research Fellow at the School of Mathematics of the University of Bristol on the project 'Inner models and infinite computations' with Prof. Philip Welch. 
My research focus is set theory -- in particular, descriptive set theory, forcing, large cardinals -- and computability. 

My mailing address is Howard House, Queen's Avenue, Bristol BS8 1SD. My office there is 2.16b. 

If you would like to get in touch with me, please email me at philipp.schlicht@bristol.ac.uk.
