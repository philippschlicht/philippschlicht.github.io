%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

We will show from the optimal large cardinal assumption that the tree property at $\omega_2$, and other compactness principles, are compatible with a $\Sigma^1_3$ well-ordering of the reals. We will also discuss the connection of this result to MA, BPFA and PFA and in general to the question of manipulating cardinal invariants at $\omega$ with the tree property at $\omega_2$. At the end we will discuss methods and open problems regarding the generalization of this result to the tree property at $\omega_3$ with a $H(\omega_2)$-definable well-ordering of $H(\omega_2)$, or in general with regard to obtaining a desired pattern of generalized cardinal invariants with the tree property.
