\begin{abstract}
   The investigation of the structural properties of club filters on uncountable regular cardinals plays a central role in modern set theory.    
   In particular, questions about the complexity of these filters motivated much of the development of generalized descriptive set theory. In my talk, I will start with a survey of results connecting questions about the definability of club filters with their  structural properties. Afterwards, I will present some recent results about the complexity of club filters on $\omega_2$ in the presence of forcing axioms. 

  This is joint work in progress with Sean Cox (VCU Richmond).
